1. Yes I believe that it is worth protecting because it gives people an incentive to make new things and not worry about their ideas from getting stolen. 

2. A solution to this would be that you could see when my idea succeeds when there are less crimes that involve copyright issues. 

3. Option 1. People could enforce copyright laws even more than they already do. 

Option 2. We could decrease the amount of time a copyright is good for. 

4. My first option would probably be the better option because people wouldn't want to have less copyright than they already do that the second option is offering. 

5. People will need to vote for this solution in order for a law to be passed to enforce copyright laws even more. They would just need to get a bill passed in congress too. 

DOL- I think this will lead to my success because by enforcing copyright laws even more, people would already want to protect what they make, so they would be fine protecting it.
